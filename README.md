## :scroll: Description
I learned to plan well before I start working on the project and this will buy me a lot of time.
And I learned that there is no impossible, there are only levels of difficulty, and in the end, every problem has a solution.
And in going through this stage, I gathered the ideas together and started working on the user interface, which is very simple 
and easy to use, and it consists of only one button.
But when you press the button, it will produce an interface for you that has three entries: title, date, and description... 
but you cannot enter them without the title, and this means the address provided that you enter it.
After the entry, the real interface will come, and the tasks will be shown in the form of cards, and there are three colors for the cards:-
White: - When the task is available
Green: - The mission is available, but its deadline is near
Red: - The task is over
And don't forget, you can edit or delete at any time you want

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
At first, there was no motivation or challenge but when I saw my classmates they were ready and excited here I decided to make this a challenge 
for me and here I finished my project and I am proud of it.
